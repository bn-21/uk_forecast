# UK Election Forecast
Dynamic forecast of voting intention in UK Parliamentary elections

## Project aims and other information

I aim here to forecast the results of the next UK General Election, in terms of both vote shares and number of seats obtained. Clearly, this will be more accurate the closer it gets to the election, and this is just a bit of fun for me so please take it with a grain of salt!
